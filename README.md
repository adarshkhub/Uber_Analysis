## Summary

Upon viewing the visual outputs we can see some clear trends displayed. The Urban city type had the highest total fares as well as the lowest average fare per ride and driver. The rural city type had the lowest total fares, while also having the highest average fare per ride and driver. It seems ideal for pyber to focus its resources on urban environments.
