## Overview
Having previously done an EDA on feaux uber data "pyber" I was curious about how the process would feel with some real data. This is an Uber data set from Kaggle showing a customer's uber usage behavior over the course of a year. 

## Results







## Summary

Upon viewing the visual outputs we can see some clear trends displayed. The Urban city type had the highest total fares as well as the lowest average fare per ride and driver. The rural city type had the lowest total fares, while also having the highest average fare per ride and driver. It seems ideal for pyber to focus its resources on urban environments.
